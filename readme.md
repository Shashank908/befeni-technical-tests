# Befeni Technical Tests

### If you have been instructed to check out this repository we are hoping to work with you and want to assess your skills in order to proceed with an interview.

In order to do this we have created two tests.

----

The [Basic Test](basic-test/readme.md) allows us to check that you have entry level programming ability and that you can use your programming language of choice to successfully solve a set of requirements. The scope of the test is intentionally kept simple so that exceptional candidates can show us their full reportoire of skills.

----

The [Advanced Test](advanced-test/readme.md) will ask you to reimplement functionality found in common frameworks and is designed to show us whether you understand design patterns and can build well architected solutions. We don't expect you to go overboard with this one - just show us that you have the understanding and skill-set we expect from a senior developers.

----

Please clone this repository, create your solutions within the two directories and then push to your own private account. Reply to the email sent from befeni.dev@gmail.com inviting you to complete these tests when you have finished.
